If we do a complete case analysis and the MCAR assumption does not hold, then any conclusions we want to draw from our results will only be valid for that specific set of people who have complete data.

Under MAR, these methods allow us to make inference about the entire sample, and therefore about the population from which your samples arose. we are right that you have a lot of data to impute, which may cause a problem.\n",
